A wheeled stool that permits an individual using a conventional wheelchair to transfer herself to a target such as a toilet,
bed, or car seat, is provided. The stool is in the form of a four-legged base that fits under the wheelchair when not in use.
The stool may be pulled forward when it is desired to transfer to a target. The user then slides forward onto the stool. 
Two clamps, one on either side of the stool permit the stool to be rotated to the left or right side of the wheelchair. 
The user now clamps from one of the side of the wheelchair and rotates the stool towards the target. The seat itself is rotatable
about its centre and the height of the seat can independently be adjusted to match the target. The user performs these adjustments
and slides herself onto the target. The device may be removed when not in use.
